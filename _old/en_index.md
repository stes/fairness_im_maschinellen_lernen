# Fairness in Machine Learning

When lending money, financial institutions are interested in giving loans only to customers who will actually repay them. If a bank gives a loan to someone who repays it with interest, they make a profit. However, if they give a loan to someone who does not repay it, they incur losses.

In this app, you can develop and try out different strategies to distribute loans as "fairly" as possible among different population groups.

To do this, you will first explore the underlying data, develop a decision-making system for lending, evaluate it, and then implement various fairness strategies.
